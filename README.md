My Idea Is to create an app that can send messeges an communicate with authorities in time of diaster.This would decrease the load on
current existing emergency hotline 112.In case of natural diaster the app will give GPS location the registered users to the resuce
authorites (if asked).Once registered the user will have 4 option buttons “Rescue me now,” “Request Medical Assistance,” “Request
supplies” and “Offer supplies",the clicked information will performe operation of providing GPS location for rescue to 
Authorities,performe operation of providing GPS location to request a medic for medical assistance to relief and rescue service 
providers,performe operation of providing GPS location to request supplies such as food ,cloths ,toiletries,etc to the relief and rescue 
service providers,getting GPS  location of the willing Volunteers who what to give supplies and help ,respectively.The would give the 
locations of those in need to volunteers and to Authorities.In case of volunteers you can offer supplies such as food toiletories to those 
who need it.The persons in  the need can go to this volunteers location or vice versa.The app would also provide articles on steps to take 
in natural diaster,first aid,what to do and what not do.On this app the authorities should be able to messege all users with emergency 
messeages such as 'tusnami is comming,go to high ground and stay their" ,"earth quake is coming,take shelter and stay their".App will show 
highlighted message such as "help is coming ","stay calm and stay inside" ,etc to prevent  the masses of people to go into panic.The app 
will be Android based.“Request supplies” option have sub options such as 'Food','Drinking Water','Cloths' and after clicking will give 
location of people who are willing to share those supplies.The app will give the locations of persons in need in the order of person 
needing medical assistnace ,person needing immidiate rescue,person needing supplies in that order.The authorities will get most clustered 
area with  need medical assitance in decresing order so Authorities can help more people in need of assitance.


The  users just need to download the app and allow use of GPS permissions.In time of need the user can select from above options and get the GPS coordinate for volunteers.

I will use GPS data to use for further use.
